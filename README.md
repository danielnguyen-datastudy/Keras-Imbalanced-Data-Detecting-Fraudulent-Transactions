# Keras-Imbalanced-Data-Detecting-Fraudulent-Transactions
Welcome to a new Keras project!

In this project, we are demonstrating how to classify a highly imbalanced dataset in which the number of examples in one class greatly outnumbers the examples in another. We will work with the [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) dataset hosted on Kaggle. The aim is to detect a mere 492 fraudulent transactions from 284,807 transactions in total. It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

We will use [Keras](../../guide/keras/overview.ipynb) to define the model and [class weights](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) to help the model learn from the imbalanced data.
